					<h3 class="center-block">The Project</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Over the course of 2 months, I produced scenarios within the Financial Service sector that leveraged one or more of the O365 services such as SharePoint, Skype, Exchange or others via Microsoft Graph. These scenarios would then be used to develop sample Add-ins, which we would share with selected partners to further advance the Add-in platform.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">My Role</h3>
					<p class="center-block">My role was to research Financial Advisors, the potential clients who seek their services, and the technologies used in the Financial Services sector, and create thoughtful conceptual designs for the possible industry partners.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Expert Insights and Brainstorming </h3>
					<p class="center-block">I collaborated with multiple industry experts to understand the domain. We began by identifying potential scenarios that would help address struggles within the industry and uncover possible solutions for these particular pitfalls.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Strategy</h3>
					<p class="center-block">I created sketches, wireframes, and low-fidelity mockups, along with user personas to communicate the initial vision for the project. This helped answer prior concerns and questions. </p>

					<p class="center-block">Help clients of Remote Advisors use a portal enhanced by Outlook services to conveniently self-schedule meetings with their advisor.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">The Discovery</h3>
					<p class="center-block">We discovered that scheduling preferences were broken down into 3 age brackets, Gen Y, Gen X and Baby Boomers.</p> 
					<p class="center-block">Most preferred one-to-one personal communication methods such as email, formal meetings at the office and phone call, but there was a strong relationship between client satisfaction with their advisors and the number of communication channels provided. The more communication channels that were provided typically led to higher satisfaction.</p>
					<p class="center-block">These insights pointed to a solution that was flexible, allowing users to select dates, times, and the mode of communication all at their fingertips.</p>  
					<h3 class="center-block">The Requirements</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Our research highlighted that keeping the application flexible would make the biggest impact.</p>
					<p class="center-block">Subsequently, we focused our efforts on the following set of requirements:</p> 
					<ul class="center-block">
						<li>Date selection</li>
						<li>Smart calendar to show only times available for both client and advisor</li>
						<li>Communication channel type selection</li>
						<li>Shared document library</li>

					<p class="center-block">Justin Enlow has worked as a Real Estate Agent for 5 years. During this period he’s been heavily invested in the stock market. About 3 years ago, he hired Alice Siciliano to help handle his finances due to his limited hours during the day. As of late, he’s become interested in a company who just announced they are going public. Knowing this, he has concluded that he should speak with Alice to see if it’s a good investment option, but since his line of work causes some time constraints, he needs a simple way to see Alice’s availability and schedule a time to meet that fits his schedule, along with Alice’s.</p>

However, our goal was to allow clients to schedule time with advisors anywhere and anytime, which transitioned our design onto a mobile interface.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">The Discovery</h3>
					<p class="center-block">A major challenge we uncovered regarding client advisor relationships is the lack of current information advisors have on their clients.</p> 
					<p class="center-block">As we all know, social media has become a major part of millions of peoples’ lives. The type of information people reveal consists of major and minor life changes that could likely benefit advisors help them cater to these individuals.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">The Requirements</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Throughout our investigation, we discovered that advisors want some means of tracking their clients to accurately manage portfolios and make the most educated decisions regarding client finances.</p>
					<p class="center-block">Efforts were focused on the following requirements:</p> 
					<ul class="center-block">
						<li>Social media connections</li>

					</div>
					<p class="center-block">In the beginning, this scenario took quite a different shape. Rather than a whiteboard, I began by sketching out a set of screens and pinning them to a tag board. I then pulled out my weapon of choice, sticky notes. Drawing quick bits of content on the sticky notes and placing them on the board allowed me to rapidly change the design by pulling off the old and setting the new in its place.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="center-block">With the general idea in mind, I began to create very low-fidelity wireframes to bring the idea to fruition. Much like the sketching phase, we began to strip the concept to its roots simplifying the design on each pass.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="center-block">The final product would allow advisors to reach out using smart premade and user-made templates. The system would continuously monitor individual clients and search for changes made on the connected social media sources. When changes were detected, email alerts were sent to the advisor and any unread alerts were tracked by the Know Your Client system.</p>

During a single analysis, I would utilize an internal set of Tenets and Traps and based on my findings I would provide a set of design recommendations. Depending on how closely we were working to establish a partnership, I would also provide a set of possible new scenarios, in turn allowing the Add-in to better utilize the Office API. In conclusion, I would then present this analysis, my design recommendations along with new feature/scenario ideas to the principal contact in the partner company.</p>

				<p class="center-block">The Office ribbon can sometimes be an area where Add-in developers tend to overlook small details. In the image above, a ceiling and baseline have been marked to indicate the ribbon boundaries. To help the partner achieve the necessary look and feel, we provided them with required icon sizes as well as the recommended inner padding.</p>
				<img class="pickitImg" src="img/PickitDesRec2.jpg" alt="Pickit Area of Improvement">
				<p class="center-block">In this particular instance, the focus was on the functionality rather than the User Interface. Considerable attention was placed on the search feature. Based on our studies, we found that users were confident in using a search bar when looking for images. Users lost confidence when images popped up that didn’t fit the search criteria.</p>
				<h3 class="center-block">Design Recommendations</h3>
				<img class="pickitRecImg center-block" src="img/pickitImprovement1.jpg" alt="Pickit Add-in Design Recommendation">
				<p class="center-block"><span>Improved Image Details: </span>Here I suggested adding photo details that will help users determine file size, image dimensions, file types, etc. Providing details such as file types will help a user determine if their files are too large to send over email or submit to some services. Additionally, providing image dimensions will assist in determining whether or not a photo becomes pixelated when manipulating the size.</p>
				<img class="pickitRecImg center-block" src="img/pickitImprovement2.jpg" alt="Pickit Add-in Design Recommendation">
				<p class="center-block"><span>Improved Sorting: </span>In this recommendation, I suggested more refinement options such as downloaded most frequently (popularity), highest rated, color, and size. The improved sorting provides the user a greater sense of control allowing them to tailor the image search results to fit color palettes, genres, and layouts.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">The Project</h3>
					<p class="center-block">The development and design choices with regard to Office Add-ins have historically lacked value and aesthetics. My team and I were hired to create a set of design patterns utilizing the Microsoft Fabric framework and work with developers to build code samples for 3rd parties, with hopes of changing the negative trajectory.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">My Role</h3>
					<p class="center-block">I was tasked with designing a set of patterns designers and developers could reference when building key parts of their Add-in. The deliverables included design specifications, design compositions, and redlines. I also utilized my development knowledge and helped build out code samples for a small set of patterns.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">Add-in Exploration</h3>
					<p class="center-block">During the exploration phase of the project I began by familiarizing myself with Add-ins keeping two main questions in mind, “what were Add-ins and what is the primary purpose of an Add-in?” I found that Add-ins are simple tools made to help users complete a given task within Office, where the current set of Office tools do not allow. Structurally, Add-ins will typically have very shallow navigational patterns, ideally never going more than a layer or two deep. Functionally, Add-ins can provide the user with a full suite of tools.</p>
					<p class="center-block">Based on these findings, I began to develop a set of five patterns:</p> 
					<ul class="center-block">
						<li><span>Commands</span> - Single layer Add-ins with one too many commands.</li>
						<li><span>Navigation + Commands</span> - Multilayer Add-ins with one too many commands.</li> 
						<li><span>Settings</span> - A page allowing users to configure settings that control the behavior of the add-in.</li>
						<li><span>Multi-Section</span> - A page with multiple sections of text content such as a privacy policy page.</li>
						<li><span>Feedback</span> - A page providing users with the ability to rate and review your add-in in the Office Store.</li>

					<h3 class="center-block">Why Commands?</h3>
					<p class="center-block">As we dug deeper into the current Add-in store, single layer multi-command Add-ins showed overwhelming prominence. However, with the lack of design direction for this pattern, the presentation began to take many shapes. Consistency being such a vital factor in good UX design we initiated an investigation into a common pattern users could refer to achieve the Office look and feel.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Exploration</h3>
					<h4 class="center-block">Existing Pattern</h4>
					<img class="commandExImg center-block" src="img/lucidChartOrig.jpg" alt="Add-in Pattern Example">
					<p class="center-block">In this example, you’ll notice this is a single layer Add-in with 3 commands within the body: Create New Diagram, Insert, and Edit.</p>
					<h4 class="center-block">Explored Variants</h4>
					<img class="commandImg center-block" src="img/cmdExploration.jpg" alt="Command Exploration Examples">
					<p class="center-block">During my exploration, my focus was on scalability. I wanted to allow developers to use this pattern regardless of the number of commands. I found that commands within the body limited the number of commands a developer could reasonably display at one time. Additionally, placing all commands within an ellipsis decreased discoverability resulting in an increased interaction cost.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Recommended Pattern</h3>
					<img class="commandImg center-block" src="img/cmdTaskPaneFinal.jpg" alt="Final Task Pane Pattern">
					<p class="center-block">The final pattern example displays five local commands and two global commands in addition to a search function, which is optional. This final pattern allows commands to be visible on the top level and if the command count exceeds the available space provided, the remaining commands are placed into an overflow menu. When the window is rescaled, allowing more commands to be displayed, those commands are taken out of the overflow and set on the main level.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Implemented</h3>
					<img class="commandExImg center-block" src="img/lucidChartPatternImp.jpg" alt="Final Task Pane Pattern Implemented">
					<p class="center-block">Once the pattern is implemented, the commanding structure allows for a much cleaner and compact UI, while also providing scalability that was missing from the original design.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">Why Navigation + Commands?</h3>
					<p class="center-block">As with single layer, multi-command Add-ins, multilayer, multi-command Add-ins were frequently featured. This pattern, in particular took many shapes and sizes due to the varied number of pages, allowing for the potential of increased interaction cost. For this design, we wanted a pattern that allowed developers to build multilevel Add-ins, provide page-specific commands, as well as global commands.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Exploration</h3>
					<h4 class="center-block">Existing Pattern</h4>
					<img class="landscapeNavCmdExImg center-block" src="img/menitMeterOrig.jpg" alt="Add-in Pattern Example">
					<p class="center-block">This example provides the user a tabbed navigational scheme on the left side, in addition to a set of commands within the body of the page.</p>
					<h4 class="center-block">Explored Variants</h4>
					<img class="navCmdImg center-block" src="img/navCmdExploration.jpg" alt="Command Exploration Examples">
					<p class="center-block">My focus for this pattern relied heavily on a consistent navigation. Rather than choosing to use a tabbed navigation scheme or a pivot scheme, I chose the hamburger menu due to its scalability and discrete presence. Utilizing this structure provided a way to limit the differences between the Commands and Navigation + Commands patterns.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Recommended Pattern</h3>
					<img class="navCmdImg center-block" src="img/navCmdTaskPaneFinal.jpg" alt="Final Task Pane Pattern">
					<p class="center-block">The final pattern displays the hamburger menu, an optional search feature, four-page specific commands and 2 global commands. This structure allowed for the greatest scalability in both numbers of pages and commands.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Implemented</h3>
					<img class="landscapeNavCmdExImg center-block" src="img/menitMeterPatternImp.jpg" alt="Final Pattern Implemented">
					<p class="center-block">The implementation of this pattern in the example above allowed me to utilize bulk actions rather than single actions on each row. Without the pattern I was unable to share multiple items at once. I was also able to maximize the amount of available space in the body of the Add-in by placing the navigational items in the hamburger menu.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">Why Settings?</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Many of the Add-ins in the store allow users to configure certain behaviors of the Add-in. These configuration pages were typically an afterthought in the overall design, utilizing the default UI provided by the HTML in addition to limited CSS styling. Due to the default behavior of these components, we encountered many unwanted UI issues.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Exploration</h3>
					<h4 class="center-block">Existing Pattern</h4>
					<img class="settingsExImg center-block" src="img/tablesChartsOrig.jpg" alt="Add-in Pattern Example">
					<p class="center-block">This current pattern utilizes an array of configuration components such as drop downs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Components have been placed into boxes to group the functions together, but as the Add-in’s size changed, elements began to overlap, resulting in congestion.</p>
					<h4 class="center-block">Explored Variants</h4>
					<img class="settingsImg center-block" src="img/settingsExploration.jpg" alt="Command Exploration Examples">
					<p class="center-block">The goal for a settings page was to allow for scalability and clean grouping. While building out the layout, I relied heavily on typographic strategies, namely leading, proper margins, type hierarchy, and weights. This allowed for a clean and straightforward layout, which developers could utilize in addition to the Fabric components.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Recommended Pattern</h3>
					<img class="settingsImg center-block" src="img/setingsTaskPaneFinal.jpg" alt="Final Task Pane Pattern">
					<p class="center-block">The final pattern didn’t veer too far from the original explorations. Rather than including an embedded privacy policy section, I decided providing links to the area lesser traveled would allow for a cleaner more compact look.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Implemented</h3>
					<img class="settingsExImg center-block" src="img/tablesChartsPatternImp.jpg" alt="Final Pattern Implemented">
					<p class="center-block">A drastic change was made to this particular Add-in once this pattern was implemented. Readability and scalability were two of the significant improvements. The only real hit was to the interaction cost associated with scrolling. However, this cost is becoming less and less prevalent due to the current trend of scrollable web pages and applications.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">Why Multi-Section?</h3>
					<p class="center-block">We found many text dominant Add-ins lacking accessibility standards. Small text, inadequate text contrast ratios, spacing and typographic hierarchy were all major fallacies. In order to provide users the best possible experience when viewing these text dominant patterns, a pattern was necessary.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Exploration</h3>
					<h4 class="center-block">Existing Pattern</h4>
					<img class="landscapeMultiExImg center-block" src="img/wikiOrig.jpg" alt="Add-in Pattern Example">
					<p class="center-block">For this particular pattern, I was able to spot multiple issues right away, such as the inconsistent spaces between words, line height, and text size. Each of these matters places stress on the users’ ability to read. As I expanded the window, the lines of text began to span the length of the Add-in, adding yet another issue to the bucket.</p>
					<h4 class="center-block">Explored Variants</h4>
					<img class="multiExImg center-block" src="img/multiExploration.jpg" alt="Command Exploration Examples">
					<p class="center-block">To avoid the aforementioned issues, I began by implementing fundamental typographic rules for increased readability. My first focus was applying a width to the text column to avoid line lengths of 75 or more characters, which is roughly the area readability starts to dip. Next, I increased the line height to 1.5% of the body text size and increased headings to two times the body text size.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Recommended Pattern</h3>
					<img class="multiImg center-block" src="img/multiSectionTaskPaneFinal.jpg" alt="Final Task Pane Pattern">
					<p class="center-block">The end result was a pattern that had the Fabric look and feel we urge users to seek when building Add-ins.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">Why Feedback?</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Feedback plays an significant role in improving the usability of an Add-in. Without a means of collecting feedback, developers are relying on in-house user testing or foregoing the practice altogether. There were very few examples to build on in the store, which could have a direct link to the lack of quality.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Pattern Exploration</h3>

					<img class="landscapeFeedbackExImg center-block" src="img/owaOrig.jpg" alt="Add-in Pattern Example">

					<h4 class="center-block">Explored Variants</h4>
					<img class="feedbackImg center-block" src="img/feedbackExploration.jpg" alt="Command Exploration Examples">
					<p class="center-block">My explored variants ranged from very minimal unobtrusive notifications to full screen or half screen prompts for feedback. Some variations displayed links to the office store, while some offered the ability to rate from within the Add-in and leave an additional review. Capacity to accept the prompt, dismiss later or never come back were all options we focused on supplying to the user.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Recommended Pattern</h3>
					<img class="feedbackImg center-block" src="img/feedbackTaskPaneFinal.jpg" alt="Final Task Pane Pattern">
					<p class="center-block">The final pattern was a very simple prompt, which only required one step to complete. This seemed to be the least bothersome approach to gain the most feedback. The prompt was system-initiated and was only displayed after the add-in runs three times.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">Sample Discovery</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Upon taking this task, I began to look into the desired functionality of the Add-in. The idea behind the LinkedIn template builder was simple; users would connect to their LinkedIn account through a client dialog, select a premade template from the list provided, and insert the template into a Word document with each of the template sections automatically filled out with their LinkedIn information.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">The Requirements</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Much of the functionality had been thought out prior to my involvement but required some polish in addition to a major User Interface overhaul.</p> 
					<p class="center-block">I began by assembling a list of requirements that needed to be completed to finish development:</p>
					<ul class="center-block">
						<li>Define user flow from A to B</li>
						<li>Define the color palette</li>
						<li>Assemble the layout</li>
						<li>Create the assets</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="center-block">Design Process</h3>
					<p class="center-block">The turnaround for a completed UI was only a couple of days, so I needed to move through this design fast. I began my process by establishing the necessary steps to complete the goal.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">User Flow</h3>
					<img class="linkedInImg center-block" src="img/linkedInFlow.jpg" alt="LinkedIn Template Builder Sample Flow">
					<p class="center-block">Three out of four steps had been established, but I knew it was missing a crucial piece, a Frist Run Experience. This is an excellent way to inform users of what the Add-in does and what kind of value it can provide.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Color Palette</h3>
					<img class="linkedInImg center-block" src="img/linkedInColor.jpg" alt="LinkedIn Template Builder Sample Color Palette">
					<p class="center-block">I chose to stick to a familiar color palette, utilizing the LinkedIn blue, white and Microsoft’s Neutral Primary.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">User Interface</h3>
					<img class="linkedInImg center-block" src="img/linkedInUI.jpg" alt="LinkedIn Template Builder Sample Variants">
					<p class="center-block">With the flow established and the color palette chosen, all that was left was the layout and imagery. I began by searching for a little inspiration on LinkedIn’s website. I didn’t want the Add-in look and feel to sway too far away from what they’ve established as a brand, but I also wanted the Add-in to fit within the Fabric design language. Productivity and connecting were two words I held on to, as these were cornerstones to LinkedIn’s mission. With this in mind, I created the imagery and assets that stayed true to these words.</p>
					<p class="center-block">With an existing template for the First Run Experience, I decided that I’d place my focus on the main interaction point, which was the selecting of the templates. There were only five templates to choose from, so I began to experiment with tiled layouts and a carousel designs.</p>

					<p class="center-block">Due to the established functionality, my goal was to take the hodgepodge of Add-in settings and display them in a manner that set up some sort of aesthetic appeal.</p> 
					<p class="center-block">The following list is what I established as the requirements:</p>
					<ul class="center-block">
						<li>Implement our UX design patterns</li>
						<li>Create assets</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="center-block">Design Process</h3>
					<p class="center-block">This was a unique Add-in in that the whole Add-in was a page or multiple pages of Fabric components. To avoid unnecessary scrolling, I utilized a navigational scheme allowing me to break the elements into similar chunks.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Information Architecture</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Given the Add-in’s functionality had already been developed, my goal was to create an architecture that allowed the user to easily navigate the given tool set. I broke the components into 3 groups; home, table, and chart. Given the shallow architecture and the limited number of pages, I selected a navigational pattern that would allow each page to remain on the top level. Also, this allowed me to provide an indicator as to which page the user was currently on.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block"></h3>
					<p class="center-block">To decrease the interaction cost associated with changing the colors and theme of the tables and charts, I took it upon myself to create small thumbnails the user could see to get an idea, a preview of sorts, of the type of change the particular selections made.</p>
