					<h3 class="center-block">The Project</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Over the course of 2 months I produced scenarios within the Financial Service sector that leveraged one or more of the O365 services such as SharePoint, Skype, Exchange or others via Microsoft Graph. These scenarios would then be used to develop sample Add-ins, which we would share with selected partners in order to further advance the Add-in platform.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">My Role</h3>
					<p class="center-block">My role was to research Financial Advisors, the potential clients who seek their services, and the technologies used in the Financial Services sector, and create thoughtful conceptual designs for the potential industry partners.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Expert Insights and Brainstorming </h3>
					<p class="center-block">I collaborated with multiple industry experts to understand the domain. We began by identifying potential scenarios that would help address struggles within the industry and uncover possible solutions for these particular pitfalls.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Strategy</h3>
					<p class="center-block">I created sketches, wireframes and low fidelity mockups, along with user personas to communicate the initial vision for the project. This helped answer prior concerns and questions. </p>

					<h3 class="center-block">The Challenge</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Help clients of Remote Advisors use a portal enhanced by Outlook services to conveniently self-schedule meetings with their advisor.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">The Discovery</h3>
					<p class="center-block">We discovered that scheduling preferences were broken down into 3 major age brackets, Gen Y, Gen X and Baby Boomers.</p> 
					<p class="center-block">Most preferred one-to-one personal communication methods such as email, formal meetings at the office and phone call, but there was a strong relationship between client satisfaction with their advisors and the number of communication channels provided. The more communication channels that were provided typically led to higher satisfaction.</p>
					<p class="center-block">These insights pointed to a solution that was flexible, allowing users to select dates, times, and the mode of communication all at their fingertips.</p>  
					<h3 class="center-block">The Requirements</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Our research highlighted that keeping the application flexible would make the biggest impact.</p>
					<p class="center-block">Subsequently, we focused our efforts on the following set of requirements:</p> 
					<ul class="center-block">
						<li>Date selection</li>
						<li>Smart calendar to show only times available for both client and advisor</li>
						<li>Communication channel type selection</li>
						<li>Shared document library</li>

					<p class="center-block">Justin Enlow has worked as a Real Estate Agent for 5 years. During this time he’s been heavily invested in the stock market. About 3 years ago, he hired Alice Siciliano to help handle his finances due to his limited hours during the day. As of late, he’s become interested in a company who just announced they are going public. Knowing this, he has concluded that he should speak with Alice to see if it’s a good investment option, but since his line of work causes some time constraints, he needs an easy way to see Alice’s availability and schedule a time to meet that fits his schedule, along with Alice’s.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">The Discovery</h3>
					<p class="center-block">A major challenge we uncovered regarding client advisor relationships is the lack of up-to-date information advisors have on their clients.</p> 
					<p class="center-block">As we all know, social media has become a major part of millions of peoples’ lives. The type of information people reveal consists of major and minor life changes that could likely benefit advisors help them cater to these individuals.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">The Requirements</h3>
					<p class="center-block">Throughout our investigation we discovered that advisors want some means of tracking their clients in order to accurately manage portfolios and make the most educated decisions regarding client finances.</p>
					<p class="center-block">Efforts were focused on the following requirements:</p> 
					<ul class="center-block">
						<li>Social media connections</li>

					</div>
					<p class="center-block">Initially this scenario took quite a different shape. Rather than a whiteboard, I began by sketching out a set of screens and pinning them to a tag board. I then pulled out my weapon of choice, sticky notes.  Sketching quick bits of content on the sticky notes and placing them on the board allowed me to rapidly change the design by simply pulling off the old and placing the new in its place.</p>

							<img src="img/kycWire.png" class="center-block img-responsive" alt="Know Your Client Wireframes">
						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="center-block">With the general idea in mind, I began to create very low-fidelity wireframes in order to bring the idea to fruition. Much like the sketching phase, we began to strip the concept to its roots simplifying the design on each pass.</p>

					<p class="center-block">The final product would allow advisors to reach out using smart premade and user made templates. The system would constantly monitor individual clients and search for changes made on the connected social media sources. When changes were detected, email alerts were sent to the advisor and any unread alerts were tracked by the Know Your Client system.</p>

During a single analysis, I would utilize an internal set of Tenets and Traps and based upon my findings I would provide a set of design recommendations. Depending on how closely we were working to establish a partnership, I would also provide a set of possible new scenarios, in turn allowing the Add-in to better utilize the Office API. In conclusion, I would then present this analysis, my design recommendations along with new feature/scenario ideas to the key contact in the partner company.</p>

					<li>Users want to be able to save photos for later use</li>
					<li>Users do not want to pay for photos</li>
					<li>Using the search bar to find images will be the main navigational feature</li>

				<p class="center-block">The Office ribbon can sometimes be an area where Add-in developers tend to overlook small details. In the image above, a ceiling and baseline have been marked to indicate the ribbon boundaries. In order to help the partner achieve the necessary look and feel, we provided them with required icon sizes as well as the recommended inner padding.</p>
				<img class="pickitImg" src="img/PickitDesRec2.png" alt="Pickit Area of Improvement">
				<p class="center-block">In this particular instance the focus was on the functionality rather than the User Interface. Considerable attention was placed on the search feature. Based upon our studies we found that users were confident in using a search bar when looking for images. Users lost confidence when images popped up that didn’t fit the search criteria.</p>
				<h3 class="center-block">Design Recommendations</h3>
				<img class="pickitRecImg center-block" src="img/pickitImprovement1.png" alt="Pickit Add-in Design Recommendation">
				<p class="center-block"><span>Improved Image Details: </span>Here I suggested adding photo details that will help users determine file size, image dimensions, file types, etc. Providing details such as file types will help a user determine if their files are too large to send over email or submit to some services. Additionally, providing image dimensions will help determine whether or not a photo becomes pixelated when manipulating the size.</p>
				<img class="pickitRecImg center-block" src="img/pickitImprovement2.png" alt="Pickit Add-in Design Recommendation">
				<p class="center-block"><span>Improved Sorting: </span>In this recommendation I suggested more refinement options such as downloaded most frequently (popularity), highest rated, color, and size. The improved sorting provides the user a greater sense of control allowing them to tailor the image search results to fit color palettes, genres and layouts.</p>

					<h3 class="center-block">The Project</h3>
					<p class="center-block">The development and design choices with regard to Office Add-ins have historically lacked value and aesthetics. This being the case, the Office store has suffered with both quantity and quality of Add-ins. My team and I were hired to create a set of design patterns utilizing the Microsoft Fabric framework and work with developers to build code samples for 3rd parties, with hopes of changing the negative trajectory.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">My Role</h3>
					<p class="center-block">I was tasked with designing a set of patterns designers and developers could reference when building key parts of their Add-in. I also utilized my development knowledge and helped build out code samples for a small set of patterns.</p>
					<h3 class="center-block">Strategy</h3>
					<p class="center-block">The beginning of each design followed a very simple strategy, find a few existing Add-ins using the pattern we are developing, assess what worked, what didn’t work, and use our design knowledge to make it better.</p>
